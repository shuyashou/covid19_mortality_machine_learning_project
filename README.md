# Covid-19 Mortality Project

### Project Summary:
In this project, we aim to investigate the intricate relationship between different factors and the mortality rate of COVID-19 by employing a range of machine-learning techniques. Our objective is to develop predictive models that not only enhance our understanding of risk factors but also aid public health strategies in mitigating the impact of pandemic.

List the deliverables from your project proposal. For each uncompleted deliverable, please include a sentence or two on why you weren't able to complete it (e.g. "decided to use an existing implementation instead" or "ran out of time"). For each completed deliverable, indicate which section of this notebook covers what you did.

If you spent substantial time on any aspects that weren't deliverables in your proposal, please list those under "Additional Work" and indicate where in the notebook you discuss them.

### Uncompleted Deliverables
1. "Expect to complete #2": we decided to use an existing implementation for our SVM

### Completed Deliverables
1. "Must complete #1": We discuss our dataset pre-processing [in "Dataset" below](#scrollTo=zFq-_D0khnhh&line=10&uniqifier=1).
2. "Must complete #2": We discuss training our logistic regression baseline [in "Baselines" below](#scrollTo=oMyqHUa0jUw7&line=5&uniqifier=1).
3. ...


### Additional Deliverables
1. We decided to add a second baseline using the published model from this paper. We discuss this [in "Baselines" below](#scrollTo=oMyqHUa0jUw7&line=5&uniqifier=1).
